### Step 1: Cloning

Clone this repository to your machine navigate to the root directory with the following terminal commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/aloan93/be-northcoders-news.git

### Step 2: Setting up a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is recommended so that we have an independent space to install required dependancies. You can set one up with the following terminal command:

```
python3 -m venv <environment-name-here>
```

It is recommended that you name your virtual environment 'venv' as this repo's .gitignore file is pre-tailored to ignore directories named venv.

Once created and visible in the root directory you can activate your environment with the following terminal command:

```
source <environment-name-here>/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Installing Dependancies

To install the required dependancies for this project you can enter the following

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
